# Objective
Purpose of this project is to develop an autonomous flying wing that will fly waypoint
missions. I am designing and building everything myself including electrical schematics,
PCB layout, component assembly, and system testing. The flight controller will be running 
on FreeRTOS and will be programmed in C.
